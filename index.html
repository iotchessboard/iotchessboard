  <h2> Welcome to IoT: Chessboard </h2>

<p> Chess is a two-player strategy game with a rich history, dating back to 7th-century India, and is played by millions of people worldwide every single day. 
The idea behind this project is to make a modernised chessboard connected to the Internet of Things (IoT) using AVR microcontrollers. 
Each chess square is illuminated if a piece is either standing on it, or a piece was moved from it during the previous turn. 
RFID-sensor technology is used to detect the positions of the chess pieces, and this data will also be used to broadcast the game live. </p>

<p> The Internet of Things is the world-wide network of electronics, software, sensors and other identifiable objects that can connectand exchange data. 
It allows for things to be remotely controlled through an existing network infrastructure, creating an imaginary bridge between the internet and the physical world.
In this project, the IoT function is powered by the ATmega4809-XPRO, with a wireless module, the WINC1500-XPRO extention board, connected to it. 
The information is sent to a web server which displays the information this webpage where you can watch the game being played live. </p>
